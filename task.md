Convert Text Search to ARM Storage Engine: Complete Project Restructure
CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
Your "kernel-text-search" repository is currently focused on:

Sprint 1: ✅ COMPLETED - C fundamentals (keep as-is)
Sprint 2: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Text processing (tokenization, inverted indexes, TF-IDF)
Sprint 3-5: 📅 PLANNED - Kernel modules, SIMD optimization, production features

The project has good foundations:

Clean repository structure with docs/, sprint directories
Text search focus with /dev/textsearch character device planned
ARM NEON SIMD optimization goals
Raspberry Pi target platform
Learning-focused documentation

CRITICAL MISSION: PIVOT TO STORAGE ENGINES
You need to convert this text search learning project into an ARM-optimized storage engine comparison project. This pivot makes sense because:

Leverages your Valkey database expertise vs learning new text processing domain
More relevant to production systems - storage engines are fundamental
Better kernel optimization story - database operations have clear kernel benefits
Real product potential - ARM-optimized embedded databases are underexplored
Clearer learning progression - from simple hash tables to complex LSM trees
