# Complete Project Restructure: C Systems Programming Learning Path

## CRITICAL MISSION
You are tasked with completely restructuring a C systems programming learning project that has suffered from severe scope creep. The project started as a "C refresher" but evolved into an impossibly complex "multi-modal hybrid database engine." Your job is to:

1. **ANALYZE** the current project state thoroughly
2. **RESEARCH** and validate better learning approaches
3. **ELIMINATE** overambitious components
4. **REDESIGN** with focused, achievable goals
5. **RESTRUCTURE** all documentation and files
6. **CREATE** a new, executable learning plan

## CURRENT PROJECT ANALYSIS

### What Exists (Good)
- **Sprint 1 COMPLETED**: C fundamentals, memory management, ARM NEON SIMD, function pointers
- **Solid foundation**: Good Makefile, testing framework, educational assembly generation
- **Quality code**: Kernel-style compilation flags, memory safety tools, documentation

### What's Broken (Critical Issues)
- **Impossible scope**: "Multi-modal database" (vector + graph + text) with kernel acceleration
- **Unrealistic targets**: "<10ms latency for 1M entities", "90% memory reduction"
- **Learning vs Production conflict**: Educational goals mixed with production ambitions
- **Overengineering**: 26 GitHub issues spanning 5 sprints of increasing complexity

### Files to Examine
The project contains these key documents:
- `docs/C-fast-track-kanban.md` - Current project roadmap (NEEDS COMPLETE OVERHAUL)
- `docs/LEARNING_PROGRESS.md` - Learning tracking
- `docs/ENHANCED_LEARNING_RESOURCES.md` - Learning materials
- `docs/sprints/sprint-X-*.md` - Individual sprint specifications
- Sprint directories with README files
- Comprehensive Makefile and tooling

## YOUR RESTRUCTURING MANDATE

### STEP 1: RESEARCH AND VALIDATE NEW DIRECTION

**Research Focus: Text Search Engine**
- Modern full-text search implementations (Lucene, Elasticsearch internals)
- Inverted index data structures and algorithms
- Kernel-space text processing benefits vs user-space
- SIMD optimization opportunities for string operations
- Learning progression from basic indexing to advanced features

**Validation Criteria:**
- Can be implemented by a single person in 3-4 months
- Clear educational progression from basic to advanced
- Meaningful kernel optimization opportunities
- Builds on existing C/systems knowledge
- Has practical applications

### STEP 2: ELIMINATE OVERAMBITIOUS COMPONENTS

**REMOVE ENTIRELY:**
- Multi-modal aspects (vector similarity, graph traversal)
- Zero-copy communication complexity
- Netlink socket implementations
- Slab allocator optimizations
- Production performance targets
- All references to "hybrid database engine"

## DELIVERABLES REQUIRED

1. **Complete file restructure** with all documents updated
2. **GitHub issue management** - close old, create new focused issues
3. **New kanban board** showing realistic sprint progression
4. **Updated learning resources** focused on text search and kernel programming
5. **Detailed sprint specifications** with implementation guides

Remember: The goal is to transform an impossible project into an achievable, educational, and professionally relevant learning experience. Be ruthless in cutting scope while maintaining technical depth and learning value.

## FINAL VALIDATION

Before completing your restructuring, verify:
- ✅ Can a competent C programmer complete this in 3-5 months?
- ✅ Are the learning objectives clear and progressive?
- ✅ Do the performance targets make sense?
- ✅ Is the scope focused and achievable?
- ✅ Will this build valuable systems programming skills?

If any answer is "no," continue reducing scope until all criteria are met.
