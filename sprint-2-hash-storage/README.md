# Sprint 2: Hash Table Storage Engine

## Overview
This directory will contain your implementation of a kernel-space hash table storage engine with ARM NEON optimizations.

## Learning Goals
- Master hash table data structures and collision resolution
- Implement kernel character device `/dev/storage-hash`
- Add ARM NEON SIMD optimizations for hash computation
- Create comprehensive testing and benchmarking

## Files to Implement
- `hash_engine.c` - Core hash table implementation
- `hash_device.c` - Kernel character device interface
- `neon_hash.c` - ARM NEON SIMD optimizations
- `tests/hash_tests.c` - Comprehensive test suite
- `Makefile` - Build system

## Learning Path
Sprint 2 is divided into focused sub-sprints for progressive learning:

- **Sprint 2A** (Issue #53): User-space Hash Table Implementation
- **Sprint 2B** (Issue #54): Basic Kernel Module Development  
- **Sprint 2C** (Issue #55): Kernel Hash Table Integration
- **Sprint 2D** (Issue #56): ARM NEON Optimizations

## Getting Started
Start with Sprint 2A (User-space Hash Table) to build foundational understanding before moving to kernel space development.

## Performance Targets (Raspberry Pi 4/5)
- Hash reads: >10,000 operations/second
- Hash writes: >3,000 operations/second
- Memory usage: <150% of raw data size
