```c
// Tokenization benchmark
START_TIMER();
tokens = tokenize_text(document, length);
STOP_TIMER("Tokenization");

// Index insertion benchmark
START_TIMER();
insert_into_index(index, doc_id, tokens);

## 📝 Performance Notes

### Why These Targets Are Realistic
1. **Hash table lookups**: O(1) average case, microsecond-level
2. **Simple tokenization**: Linear scan, optimizable with SIMD
3. **TF-IDF calculation**: Simple arithmetic, vectorizable
4. **Kernel overhead**: Minimal for well-designed IOCTL

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Over-optimization**: Focus on correctness first
2. **Premature SIMD**: Get scalar version working properly
3. **Complex locking**: Start with coarse-grained locks
4. **Feature creep**: Resist adding "just one more feature"

### Performance Mantras
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- "Measure twice, optimize once"
- "The fastest code is code that doesn't run"
- "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"

*Remember: These targets are for learning. Real production systems like Elasticsearch or Lucene have person-years of optimization. Focus on understanding the principles rather than matching commercial performance.*
